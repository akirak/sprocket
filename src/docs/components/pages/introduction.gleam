                    Welcome to the official documentation of Sprocket, a real-time server-side components library for Gleam! In this guide, we'll
                    cover the core concepts of Sprocket, but some prerequisite knowledge of Gleam is recommended. Gleam is a type-safe functional language designed
                    to harness the power of the Erlang Beam virtual machine. Whether you are a seasoned Gleam enthusiast or new to this exciting language,
                    this documentation will serve as your roadmap to building highly scalable, robust, and efficient server-side components.

                      intuitive syntax, making it effortless to reason about complex systems and craft maintainable codebases.

                      Sprocket was born out of a vision to bridge the gap between functional component views, type-safety, and the real-time server renderd
                      applications. With Sprocket, developers can quickly construct server-side live views without compromising on type-safety and maintainability.
                      By leveraging the Erlang Beam VM, Sprocket enables high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and real-time server renderd applications that 
                      reduce the amount of code required to build rich web applications.
